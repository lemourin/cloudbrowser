Usage analytics are handled by AppCenter service.

The user before using the app needs to authorize using their Google account;
this creates a Firebase account with user's email available to the developer.

The app stores user's credentials on user's device and in remote 
Firebase database for the purpose of synchronizing added cloud accounts 
between user's Android devices.
